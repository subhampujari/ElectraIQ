# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

A data-driven end-to-end analysis of Electric Vehicle adoption, performance, and policy alignment. This project covers everything from data cleaning and exploration to visualization and presentation, using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (MySQL):** Data cleaning, filtering, type conversion, preprocessing  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** Pandas, SQLAlchemy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Pandas Profiling / YData Profiling:** Automated EDA for in-depth data profiling
- **Power BI:** Interactive, multi-page report design and visual analysis
- **Canva:** Presentation Design

## Key Analysis Areas

- EV population distribution by make, model, and year  
- Performance comparison of BEVs vs. PHEVs (electric range)  
- CAFV eligibility insights and policy impact  
- Geographic trends in EV adoption (county-level analysis)  
- Top-performing models and manufacturers  
- Business recommendations based on real data patterns
