/*
If you're also lazy like me, when it comes to create table structure, 
especially when the dataset is too large; then don't worry. Just use Pandas!

I auto-generated this SQL using Pandas, just to avoid writing everything manually.😂
You can use this method:
______________________________________________
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("file-path", nrows=10)

for col in df.columns:
    print(f"`{col}` VARCHAR(255),")
______________________________________________
Just replace the file-path, with your actual file path, and you're good to go.
For datatypes, if you know, change it before creating the table itself, else
just change it later when needed.

But if, you're not lazy, just write it all by yourself, there's nothing wrong either.😅

Well, do whatever you like!

For almost 90%+ of the records, Base MSRP is

	# Usable for limited historic pricing insight
	# Not usable for current market price analysis
    

MSRP data is available for earlier EV models (2008–2020) 
but largely missing for recent years, limiting price 
trend analysis. However, historic prices suggest 
EVs initially entered the market as premium vehicles, 
with some models priced over $80,000.

MSRP is a weak spot in the dataset and not worth visualizing 
further. Too many blanks, and it won't reflect today's market.
