# ElectraIQ

A data-driven end-to-end analysis of Electric Vehicle adoption, performance, and policy alignment. This project covers everything from data cleaning and exploration to visualization and presentation, using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

Check out the complete article I have written on this Project: Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

Tools & Technologies
SQL (MySQL): Data cleaning, filtering, type conversion, preprocessing
Python (Jupyter Notebook): Pandas, SQLAlchemy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Pandas Profiling / YData Profiling: Automated EDA for in-depth data profiling
Power BI: Interactive, multi-page report design and visual analysis
Canva: Presentation Design
Key Analysis Areas
EV population distribution by make, model, and year
Performance comparison of BEVs vs. PHEVs (electric range)
CAFV eligibility insights and policy impact
Geographic trends in EV adoption (county-level analysis)
Top-performing models and manufacturers
Business recommendations based on real data patterns
